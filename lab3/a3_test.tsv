0	"Extremely rare" is only good if it doesn't happen to you. It's not the job of medical researchers to decide if the risk is worth it. The decision needs to rest with the patient who is assuming the risk. And coercion from the medical and political authorities prevents proper informed consent because you aren't really consenting if you will be punished for refusing consent.
1	"I have two parents in their 70s. Both had the vaccine, and both got Covid." Yeah, but sir, are they the one's in the hospital hooked up to all of the machines? And now, after seeing the end of the video clip, dead.
0	"Not getting vaccinated is still more dangerous." Uh-huh. Right.
1	"The average life expectancy of a human is 74 years" Anti-vaxx Parents: That's where you're wrong kiddo
1	"Trust the science" is a dumb saying. Science is a process, you research, experiment, and improve. However, doing all of these things just proves that the vaccine works...
1	"You're downplaying the risks of vaccines." As opposed to downplaying the risks of measles, polio, smallpox, etc?
0	17 million adverse reactions is not a ‘slight’ reaction! Stop playing it safe and tell the truth about the reality.
1	1st doses of the covid vaccine have been taken today in america, which is a step towards ending this pandemic and getting back to shows, festivals, clubs, going out, and normal life. Still a long way to go but shoutout scientists, doctors, healthcare workers, and 1st responders.
0	3 people i know 2 are relatives 2 with blood clots 1 in knee 1 in lung othere fatuigue ever since 2nd jab this is not rare this is vaccince injury
0	3rd shot = Violent coughing, spitting up mucus, head ache, wicked itchy throat, ANGER. IVE BEEN SICK FOR OVER A WEEK REALLY SICK!!!!
0	4-6-21 JJ vaccine 4-14-21 blood clots massive heart attack.
1	A dear person to me in a high risk group was really scared from all the buzz about how dangerous the vaccines are, but they went and took it and I'm super proud of them.
0	A friend of mine had a stroke, just 2 weeks after his second covid vaccine ...! Coincidence? I doubt it!
0	A vaccine that hasn’t been properly tested, they don’t know the long term serious health implications, so why promote this, it’s a joke, I’m not having it
0	AMEN. I REFUSE ALL SHOTS N VACCINES NOW. NEVER KNOW WHATS MIXED IN IT
1	Absolutely! Side effects have been mild to nonexistent for me after the first one.
1	Absolutely. For me, being a college student, the benefits far outweigh the risk. I love your videos, and thank you for keeping us all informed about this new type of vaccine.
1	Absolutely. I just got COVID and it sucked hardcore. I plan on getting a booster as soon as I'm eligible.
0	Advance R.I.P. to those who will take covid vaccines.
0	After I got my vaccines, I had terrible side-effects. Painful headaches, body soreness, and fatigue. Basically they made a whole day for me miserable.
0	After my second Pfizer shot I had. 105.2 fever and convulsions… then pneumonia for 2 weeks… the doctors wanted me to keep my mouth shut and not blame the shot I received
1	Ah crap I got polio. BuT AtlEaST i dOnT haVE AutIsM
1	All anti vaxx people need to watch this
0	All of the anti-vaxxers out there I've got one message for all of you I salute you keep up the good work
1	All shots and boosters. No covid. And I’m getting 5G reception better than ever.
1	And now there's a possible measles outbreak in Oregon/Washington, thank God I'm vaccinated
0	And still hasn't been proven safe
0	And they don't work! Great job.....
0	And they still have the audacity to encourage people to get like the thousandth booster
0	And yet somehow puberty blockers have been allowed to be used. Also, there’s an interview with RFK about a cdc study that linked vaccines to autoimmune and neurological conditions.
1	Anti vaxers are some of the dumbest and most dangerous people on the planet
1	Anti-Vaxxers are people who have to cross a river, see a bridge and think to themselves: Nah, I'm gonna swim, just in case the bridge collapses!
1	Anti-vaxers are a good example of a modern form of natural selection.
1	Apparently the vax for the newest variant comes out in September? I’m planning to get vaccinated
1	Are people really going to be skeptical over any new health tech advancement that comes our way? Like get with the times it's not 1960 anymore the world will advance whether you like it or not
1	As a nurse working at an infectious disease ward: of the many patients I’ve met who were vaccinated and still got COVID, the large majority of them had a mild version of it. They might as well just have had a bad cold.
0	As an unVaxed person l feel bad for the people that were feared into taking the poison..
1	As someone from a third world country, I'm envious that US even have the privilege to have so many unfilled appointments. Meanwhile, countries like us here in Southeast Asia are getting desperate to get more supply for vaccines because so many people are in need of it yet are finding it difficult to get vaccinated because of lack of supply. Then countries like the US still have so many people not going to their appointments...
1	As someone who can't have most vaccines due to anaphylaxis, I am completely for Vaccines. Herd Immunity is the only thing that will protect me and thousands of others
0	As someone who hasn't had ANY covid jabs I can say it's been very strange. I've never known so many people to have colds and flu! I haven't caught so much as a sniffle. The family that gave me a hard time about not having the jab aren't saying anything now.
0	Basic question: When and why EVER would anyone take last year’s flu shot? None of this makes sense.
0	Because normal vaccines take 7 years to approve, and these never went through that process. ANd based on VAERS data, they never would get approved in the normal manner.
0	Best thing i never did.. never trust a politician or Bill gates with your health.. the end.
0	By not taking the shots I am 100% safe from adverse reactions and 99.98% safe from Covid
0	C19 was chapter one. The pharma industrial complex wants their next profitable pandemic. Coming soon.
1	COVID booster before the weekend and chill
0	Can you imagine how many would not have taken the jab if they knew this, the government cannot be allowed to do this again.
0	Can you please explain why people who are double and triple vaxed are still contracting the virus and getting sick from it? Considering your description of how the vax works :)
1	Can't fully understand why anti-vaxxers would still exist after this pandemic gave us all some idea of what a vaccine-free world would look like!
0	Caused my step grandfather to have a stroke, now he's blind, and a 33 year old healthy co-worker died a few days afterwards, so no thanks!
1	Choose Pfizer if you can. Fantastic protection, I had it. No side effects for me and I did get close to people who had covid but I didn't get any symptoms
1	Congrats for the two scientists who won the noble prize in medicine this year(2023) for their novel technique of developing vaccines
0	Controlled opposition' to be ridiculed in public and to discredit the 'anti-vaxxers'. I am a 'non-vaxxer', just like I am a 'non-smoker' and I will not tell others what they shouldn't put in their arms. Let them, but don't cry to me if it goes wrong and please don't try to tell ME what to do, as it isn't your business.
1	Covid is still killing people. Vaccination has been demonstrated over and over again to reduce the risk of severe infection (expressed in the data as hospitalization) and death.
1	Currently sitting in the staging area for my COVID and flu shot. I can’t bear the thought of someone with immune system issues getting sick because I didn’t.
1	Definitely! We n95 mask too and have never had Covid. Life is hard enough without being sick, possibly long term, or worse.
1	Delta almost killed me. If I hadn't been vaccinated I know I wouldn't be here.
1	Delta would have been extremely ugly without a vaccine or if it had been the first pandemic strain.
0	Did anyone see the data from pfizer...nearly 1300 side affects!...so if youve had a few shots...you really must love to gamble..
0	Did anyone see the data from pfizer...nearly 1300 side affects!...so if youve had a few shots...you really must love to gamble...
1	Doctors who study 8+ years vs. A person who looks information up.
0	Don't need it survival rate is 99.5% in UK less than 400 people have died under age of 60 with no underlying problems. 400 people drown every year in UK.
0	Don't take this poison
0	Dont trust it!! The ingredients list is disgusting. Untested and approved by cronies.
0	Dr. Rochagné Kilian, an ER doctor in Owen Sound, Ontario, Canada, says she saw only two patients in 2020 who tested positive for Covid and had respiratory problems. Over an 18-month period, no one was admitted to the ICU with Covid symptoms, and most of the time staff was waiting around to treat Covid patients that never showed up. She said that, since the vaccines were introduced, everything changed. The hospital had an uptick in cardiovascular cases, including heart attack, heart failure, stroke, pericarditis, and peripheral vascular diseases occurring in younger patients without related prior history. She says many other patients complained of other symptoms, such as skin rashes and nose bleeds appeared after they had taken the vaccine. She reported that no records were being kept regarding how many patients were vaccinated or suffered side effects. Standard treatments for respiratory illnesses were replaced by new Covid protocols, which harmed the patients instead of curing them.
0	Dude people are dying from this mess.
0	During covid, my mother was 89 yrs old, frail and living in a nursing home. She refused the covid vaccine. She is still alive today at 93.
1	Every vaccine comes with risks. A very small percentage of COVID vaccine recipients had lasting negative effects. The vast majority get nothing more than a sore arm for a few days. Medical research and doctors always assess risk vs benefit.
0	Everyone who falsely vlaimed these were SAFE AND EFFECTIVE... Should be jailed.
1	Everyone's about anti vaccination until their dog gets rabies
0	Feel very bad for eveyrone that injected this into their body. May god have mercy on your souls.
1	Fortunately, I felt fine after my first shot recently, but my upper arm ( where I got the shot) got pretty sore about 8 hrs after the shot, but I'm doing well, I presently feel no ill affects
1	Fully vaccinated gang, where are you at? I just had my second vaccine today. Also, anti-vaxxers are just acting like clowns
1	Gen X here, got mine last month along with my flu shot.
1	Get the vaccine. Don’t be afraid let’s try to get things back to normal.
1	Get vaccinated PLEASE I miss traveling I miss conventions I miss hanging with friends!
1	Getting my first dose today :)
0	Give it a little more time and most vaccinated people will see the true effects of the vaccine.. this is a bad situation..
0	Got Covid from a family member. Still didn’t get vaccinated. And I’m doing fine years later.
1	Got covid vax and flu vac at the same time. It’s completely normal.
1	Got mine last week
1	Got my COVID booster and flu shot a few weeks ago. I'm absolutely continuing to get them. I have friends with long COVID. It's no joke.
1	Got my Covid vaccine a month ago; just got my flu shot and my first Shingles shot (yay being 50!). Just to share: I was dreading the shingles vaccine as I heard it was tough. It was nothing. Maybe a little more sore than flu shot, but nothing like what I read about online. Now maybe the second dose will be tougher, but everyone: don’t fear the shingles shot. DO fear shingles, though, so get your two doses!
1	Got my first dose a month ago and i felt pale and had a sore arm for 2 days. Just got my second dose and it felt like nothing even happened.
1	Got my first shot yesterday so far no feeling of side effect. Ty Pfrizer
1	Got my shot on Saturday as a healthcare worker. Felt good aside from arm soreness the next couple of days.
1	Got my vaccine a while ago, no side effects whatsoever. Same goes for my family members and friends.
0	Got vaccinated today and all my body’s aching like hell!!
0	Had many family members either straight up or heavily imply that I was an idiot for refusing to get vaccinated. So glad I held my ground.
1	Had this vaccine! It was amazing, I have asthma so it probs saved my life/stoped me from going to hospital! Proud to be vaccinated and one of the first!
1	Have not had Covid. Got the vaccination and annual booster. Felt completely fine.
0	Have you guys apologised to the people you persuaded to get injected? Or all they dead now anyway?
1	Hearing people in the 1st world country saying vaccines are harmful makes me really sad and angry at the same time.
0	Hello! I am not super eduated on this topic as I've not taken a biology course in years, however, I am concered about any long-term effects the vaccine can have especially because unlike other vaccines, this vaccine has not had years of research to determine any possible long term effects.
0	Hmmm........I'll just keep washing my hands, not touching my face, cover my mouth and nose when I sneeze, and stay home when I feel sick.
1	How do these anti vaxxers actually believe they can argue with a legitimate pediatric physician about this topic?
0	How do they work? They don't.
0	How is not getting vaccinated for a disease with 98%-99% recovery rate 'more dangerous'?
0	How many "rare" side effects have to happen before it's called common?
0	I Tried to warn ya. But yall said I should be denied medical care , left to die, and denied entry to buy food, left to starve......I'll never forget.
1	I actually got my second dose of the vaccine today! I also took the time to thank the healthcare workers for taking all the time to make sure we're all healthy. Me and my whole family got covid back in December and trust me, you do NOT want it. My dad went into the hospital and stayed there for 2-3 weeks, and I was very close to doing the same thing. Please, get the vaccine once you're offered it.
0	I actually wept when I heard people were giving their children the JAB!
1	I already get the vaccine!
1	I always get mine. I got my Covid and flu vacc just last week, good to get them together.
1	I am an EMT in the CA bay area and I have both shots of the moderna vaccine. I only had soreness in my arm for both shots with no side effects. Yall better get the vaccine when it comes out!
0	I am so glad I never got the vaccine. Almost lost my job because of it too. But I stood my ground and thank God it all worked out. Wish more people did the same
0	I am soooo f*ckin' glad I said no.
0	I believe my dad had the shot and then a lot of his organs started shutting down. He died 9/5/24
0	I chose to protect myself from exposure instead of taking the vaccine. I don't want to take something we are "still learning about." So far, my approach has worked.
1	I did that two years ago and got sick from doing them together. I felt crappy but not as crappy as I would have felt getting the flu or Covid!
1	I did with my flu shot. I was going to be traveling, and didn’t want to get sick. Seemed like everyone in the airport was coughing really bad…
0	I didn't get injected, got covid and had no symptoms at all. Got infected by my peers who all got the injection ... and despite or because of this injection they all had severe symptoms.
0	I didn't need the shot because my perfectly functional immune system sorted the issue out for me.
1	I didn’t realize vaccination was a problematic issue. It’s common sense, get vaccinated
0	I didn’t take it and I’m very happy about it.
1	I do! I’m immunocompromised and will take every vaccine I can get. Vaccines work. And Covid is still evolving as does the flu. So yup. I get them
1	I do. And my flu vaccine. I’m smart
1	I feel like this video should be on the evening news everyday to reduce fears of the vaccine and educate the public.
1	I felt a little light headed for about 15 minutes and that was it.
1	I get mine every year, with my flu shot. Except this year. I had to have a hysterectomy and I can’t get vaccines for a while. I’ve become the person that you protect by getting your vaccines. Thank you!
0	I get sick after being around the newly vaccinated. Please tell our leaders to stop giving these.
1	I get the boosters every year. I got it once and I never wanna be that sick in my life again
1	I get them. Along with the flue vaccine. Not getting sick > getting sick
0	I got 4 Moderna vax. NEVER AGAIN
0	I got a stroke 14 days after my first dose of Pfizer which caused me to get a blood clot in my brain...this is crazy I thought I was the only one
1	I got all mine. N a booster I'm healthy.
1	I got both Pfizer vaccines and I never had a single problem other than a sore arm the next day. This was about 3 months ago now. My entire family except my grandpa (who got moderna’s instead) got Pfizer and was perfectly fine.
0	I got frowned upon by some friends and family for not having vaccines, I bet some of those people wouldn’t have the jabs if they could go back
1	I got it, mostly to feel like I’m doing something to prevent my family getting COVID. Also, I like vaccines.
1	I got mine with my flu shot. A friend got COVID after a cruise and I don't want to go through that.
1	I got mine, 2 days ago, only felt like itching in the area surrounding the shot but nothing serious, now i am feeling great. i got the Pfizer one
0	I got my first shot 10 days ago and I have been very Ill. Went to hospital 3 days ago, was diagnosed with covid.
1	I got my first shot yesterday, arm is little sore, other than that no side effects.
1	I got my second vacine yesterday. I had a case of the chills and slight headache lastnight and part of this morning , feeling 100% now. I admit I was a little worried if it would react with my epilepsy medications. But I took a deep breath and did it. It's a great relief off my mind. I honestly felt a big weight lifted off my shoulders and have peace of mind concerning this mess.
0	I got my vaccine. It’s a blend of various whiskeys from Scotland. It’s truly amazing!
0	I got pfizer biontech shot today i can alredystart speaking german.
1	I got shot #6 in the past month, along with the annual flu shot. If there’s a flu shot, there’s a COVID shot and I’m getting both. Hurts like a sonuvabeech for two days but better than being a dead vax-denier.
1	I got the booster, I want to avoid being sick if I can.
0	I got the first shot of Sinopharm and I am always feeling tired and sleepy after the vaccine, Now I took at least 14 hours sleep in a day but before vaccination I was hardly sleep only for 8 hours.
0	I got very loud tinnitus 5 days after pfizer second dose. Still suffering 2 months later.
1	I had 1st shot of Pfizer yesterday morning, no severe sad effects, just felt hungry and about 30 minutes light headache in the afternoon. I have been on diet. Yesterday I had to eat three good meals, with carb, red meat, vegetables, fruits, nuts, fish now I feel normal.

0	I had Astra Zeneca, Moderna and pzifer. I was scared, I have severe asthma, I didn’t want to die. How the hell do I get this out of my body it’s my biggest regret getting all 3 it keeps me up at night
0	I had an allergic reaction to the JJ vaccine. I never had heart issues before in fact one physician years ago said you have a great heart. I am now on blood thinners and HBP meds. I also now am fighting cancer. Never had issues and been healthy!
1	I had my first shot a few days ago. The only side effect I had was a mild headache and a slight tender arm. Only lasted a few hours.
1	I had one dose of Pfizer so far. Good to see actual explanation of what the vaccine does.
0	I had so many family members try to tell me that I was reason that COVID persisted because of not getting vaccinated. They are not saying that now.
1	I had the vaccine and the three subsequent boosters. I had zero symptoms. Don’t listen to anti vax people
1	I hate how these anti-vax soccer moms say they do "research", when their idea of research is visiting the second page of google search results
1	I hate when stupid parents think their anecdotal experience means it happens regularly. Even 1 in 3000 is still extremely rare. It's still much more likely you'll be harmed by the disease, not the potential side effects. And no, parents don't understand their child medically best. They aren't doctors.
0	I have a concern about stacking lots of vaccines together...what that may cause. How they react to each other.
0	I have believed from the beginning coviid was over exaggerated
0	I have developed peanut and cat allergies at 22.. nobody in my family is allergic to peanuts. I got 2 doses of the Moderna.
1	I have heard of people getting sick or dying from COVID, never heard of this happening from vaccines. Common sense seems to be lacking among anti-vaxxers unfortunately.
0	I have never been vaxed and I have never had covid. All my friends who have been vaxed have had covid
1	I hope this vaccine can get to as many people as possible as soon as possible. I'd rather take my chances with 72% effectiveness than 0% effectiveness.
1	I just got COVID and it sucked hardcore. I plan on getting a booster as soon as I'm eligible.
1	I just gotta say, if you’re an anti vaxxer, you either have trypanophobia, or you’re ableist
1	I just had my 4th jab 2nd booster today wish me luck
0	I just lost my job yesterday in NSW because I'm not getting any "vaccine" poisons.
1	I just vaccinated today
0	I know 4 people who died after the viper jab. Others have had strokes
0	I know 4 ppl who got sick after the covid vaccine Also why are deaths & heart attacks rising so much
0	I know a perfectly healthy man under 40 that had a heart attack within 15 days of being given his first jab. No thanks
0	I know many people who regret getting the vaccines. I don't know anyone who regrets refusing them.
0	I know one person who died of heart attack at 38, and another one who got a blood clot in brain, both were healthy prior to vaccine.
0	I like how all they ever talk about is how safe they are yet make no mention of the vaccines being suspended in multiple countries due to blood clots.
1	I like how the random anti vaccine mom is trying to tell the doctor he’s wrong lol
1	I literally lost my best friend because I retweeted a pro vaccination tweet. Anti Vaxxers lose their shit if you don’t agree with them, and trust me her argument against them was hilarious.
1	I long for a society where we can all at least agree that science is one of the most amazing and important achievements of humanity. It is literally the reason human beings live so long these days. Science and medicine progress has given us prolonged life!
1	I mean, I got vaxxed and boosted for COVID-19. I caught it early last year on account of my aunt having it and was down for about a week. Howeve, I managed to bounce back that to some Paxlovid, plus the virus wasn't as bad due to the vaccine. Had I not been vaxxed I would be on a ventilator with fluid building up in my lungs, js
0	I never got the vaccines. I always knew they were rushed and weren’t tested as it was stated. So naturally I had developed skepticism (which I think is healthy to have). I never did get Covid. Actually I’ve never been healthier. I only really ever get sick if I eat junk food.
0	I never took the vaccine I'm not stupid
0	I personally know of four that died after their first jab. Two others now have rare cancers after their jabs. Must be climate change!
1	I planned to get it, and then I got Covid. Definitely recommend getting it because it’s been horrible being this sick in late pregnancy.
0	I pray the population wakes up and refuses ANYTHING like this in future!!!
1	I rather get tired and have a fever for a few days rather than carry a virus tbh
1	I really want to hear people's opinions, but then I hear some anti-vaxxers and I want to backflip off a cliff
1	I recently saw the video jubilee posted about anti vaxxers vs pro vaxxers and one of the anti vaxxers literally told a DOCTOR to do his research. This woman has no medical background whatsoever. The audacity of some of these people!
1	I recommend all my patients, young and old, to get vaccinated against covid unless a legitimate allergy could cause harm with the vaccine.
0	I refused the vaccine and endured so much harassment from my employer, but I stood my ground.
0	I remain proudly unvaxxed. Have had Covid four times, and am still here!
1	I remember hearing this story of this mum who wouldn't let her child get vaccinated, so the child (12 years old) took it upon himself to get the vaccine without his mum knowing! VERY SMART KID! AND TRUE STORY
0	I see strong and healthy people who know that they don't need garbage to survive. Antivaxxer for life. My body works perfectly fine.
1	I still don't understand how people are more afraid of the vaccine than the virus that's killed 500k Americans
0	I still smell smoke after my Moderna, but its not all the time. It scares the hell out of me....
1	I swear the thought process that went into these vaccines was clever as hell. Like, who thinks of using our own body to make the key markers of a virus which it will use to identify said virus? That's the most ingenious piece of biomedical engineering idea I've ever heard of.
1	I think the problem is ultimately the education about these vaccines. The information needs to be transparent, clear, relatable, and easy to understand. This kind of video needs to be more accessible and shared around on common media so people understand.
0	I took large amounts of vitamin D3, hugged covid patients, took no Vax and still never got covid, the D3 saved me
1	I vaccinated both of mine as soon as it was available. At the time they were 8 months and 3 years old. No side effects or reactions. My 3 year old unfortunately got Covid for the first time 3 months before the vaccine was available and developed nerve damage as a result. Will get them the vaccine every time. Covid sucks.
0	I want you all to know. I'm 38. If a nurse hadn't told me to my face after looking around to make sure no one could hear she told me not to get it and that they weren't sure if it was helping or hurting people. If she didn't tell me that I would have absolutely no faith in any of the medical staff. Ever again. She earned it to me . I thanked God for that woman. I was vulnerable and she guided me true.
1	I was also pretty anti-vax. But when I got Lymphoma, I started realizing that not everything can be treated naturally. Then COVID came along and it shocked me that people wouldn’t get vaccinated for a current and serious threat! My son was born this last April and while I was scared to vaccinate him at his regular wellness appointments, I’m so glad I did! I no longer trust people who have no medical background that think they know more than the professionals
0	I was around 13 when i got the vaccine i only had 1 shot of pfizer but i am so angry at my mum for making me get it i cant forgive her for her foolishmess i would rather miss a week of school with a small cough then have my heart beating rapid
0	I was unaffected because I never took the poison vaccine
1	I was undergoing chemotherapy when covid hit. My treatment was put on hold so I could be vaccinated. I have had 5 vaccines in total. I survived cancer and I am also one of the few people I know who has never had covid. I saw what covid did to my healthy friends. I would not have survived it.
0	I was vaccine injured, I became covered in a mottled purple rash after the second shot that looked like blood poisoning and lasted 6 months. I will never get another vaccine.
1	I will finally get the first dose in a few days. Can’t wait to feel more safe again when the world goes a little back to normal in the future.
1	I will get it as soon as they allow me to!
0	I will say it again I will never regret NOT taking their poison jab
1	I wonder how many of the people that “I ain’t wanna put nun chemicals in my body” how many of them eat fast food, drink soda, smoke cigarettes, get their nails done, hair dyed, eat pre packaged food etc etc etc.
0	I wonder if they’re gonna make more videos when the 246th shot comes out and the 319th booster is available. Keep trying to convince people to take medicine that’s fresh on the market no one really knows about. Not weird at all
0	I work in healthcare in Canada and I do not recommend the shot. If you are healthy, have no preexisting conditions, don’t bother. I’ve met too many patients with amputations due to blood clots after receiving the shot.
1	I would follow the advice of your local Public Health unit or doctor; not Reddit - but in this case I’m glad to see the majority of comments are pro-booster!
1	I would get them twice a year if they'd allow it. Some people are deadly stupid about COVID.
0	I wouldn't take it. The body heals it self. If they attempt to force anything on me, trust me, we will have a BIG PROBLEM.
0	I would’ve rather had a walking dead pandemic. No more government, no taxes, no having to suffer a work day everyday, and no more society. Just me, my dog, and my gun.
1	I'll get it for sure.
0	I'll pass. My cells are not the medical establishment's to play with.
0	I'm 81 still alive no covid vaccine here
1	I'm almost fully vaccinated, and no antivaxxer can tell me what to do
1	I'm anti-eating because there's a chance I can get food poisoning, and me no like tummy ache.
1	I'm anti-seatbelt because I can still die or be injured in a car accident.
0	I'm concerned about the profit motive of pharmaceutical companies that produces vaccines. I don't want to support an industry that prioritizes profits over people's lives.
1	I'm double jabbed with the Pfizer vaccine. Apart from very slight arm ache, I've had no other issues. I haven't had COVID either.
1	I'm getting all of the recommended vaccines, which includes covid.
0	I'm glad I didn't get that shyt
0	I'm good. My immune system is fine.
1	I'm just happy this vaccine exists. The numbers regarding allergic reactions are reassuring, and catching the side effects of the vaccine looks comparatively better than catching the virus.
0	I'm not gonna take it.
0	I'm not taking the clot shot, I'm never going to and god bless the brave ppl would stood up
1	I'm one of those people who were "at risk" due to having health complications prior to covid. I got it around June 2020 and was pretty much bedbound for a month. After the vaccine, I got the virus again and was still sick, but only for about 2 weeks, and it wasn't nearly as bad of a sickness. Haven't had it since, to my knowledge.
0	I'm terrified
0	I've got all my vaccinations, plus a few from the Navy. I was never going to take this rushed mystery drug, though, and I still won't.
1	I've got it when i wad 15. Im 16 now. It has been very, very helpful! I haven't got Covid since. Thank you for this video :D
1	I've had mine every year; never gotten Covid.
1	I've had mine every year; never gotten Covid. My husband gets his too but unfortunately not soon enough this year - he caught it for the first time about six weeks ago and still can't taste anything much. I figure it's inevitable that I will eventually catch it but trying to put it off as long as I can.
1	I've stayed up to date on being vaxxed and boosted. I ended up catching COVID last year and I thought it was the most gentle head cold I've ever experienced. I only tested myself because my kid was feeling a bit under the weather and so we tested her before school. When she tested positive, I tested myself. Based on my experience, I'm grateful I got the shots.
0	ILL STICK WITH GOD'S IMMUNITY CAN'T BEAT PERFECTION!!!!!
0	IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY BENEFITS!!! But the risks are astronomical!!!
0	If I got stopped on the street by a drug pusher and told I couldn't go anywhere until id taken his drugs that would be illegal would it not.. wheres the difference now.
0	If I were vaccinated...I'd be very very concerned about my health immediately
0	If a woman is allowed to “choose” an abortion up to the day of birth because it’s her body, her choice…then I can choose to not inject myself with ANYTHING that I don’t know enough about.
0	If devil tells you what to do, do the opposite!
0	If the risk of adverse reactions to the COVID vaccines is so low, why do the pharma companies need legal immunity?
0	If the vaccine works, why are vaccinated people still getting sick?
0	If there's no randomized studies on MMR vaxx, how did they get approved in the 1st place? To the extent that they are being mandated. Relying on epidemiology studies seems to indicate that we're giving the vaxx to kids before assessing its real benefits and risks. ???
0	If vaccines are safe, the manufacturers should not be shielded from lawsuits.
1	If we've gotten to the point where we're questioning vaccines we've become too privileged
0	If you're so willing to obey authority that you'll take chemicals into your arm just because your told you need it, you're too far gone.
1	If your child has an autoimmune disorder you should be PRO vaccine, even if it means not vaccinating that child. You need the healthy children around your child to be vaccinated so they don't spread these preventable illnesses to yours
0	Im against vaccine mandates
0	Im so tired of the lies and deceptions.
0	Im unvaccinated and alive. The best part of it is not getting myocarditis.
1	Imagine explaining all this to people 200 years ago. They would send you to a mental hospital. We cannot fathom how fast science has progressed since then.
0	Imagine these vaccines don't work on incoming variants, and WHO has to make another vaccine and all those fully vaccinated still need another dose lmao the business keeps going
1	In case you have taken the vaccine and are in need of reassurance… I have gotten the Moderna and have had 2 healthy pregnancies. All my family has taken the shot and there hasn’t been any bad side effects since.
1	In my country babies are only eligible for flu vaccine not covid vaccine - I wish I had the choice to give it to him!
0	In time we will see what the Covid vaccine actually does to people. This will be seen as a lesson in how to avoid fascism.
1	It blows my mind how people are able to disregard mountains of scientific evidence based on their anecdotal experiences.
0	It is illegal to injection an unknown substance into humans. If adjuvant not revealed violation of informed consent. Disgusting.
1	It really frustrates me that the antivaxxers got way more time to speak and just ignored literally everything the doctor said
1	It strenghtens the inmune system!
1	It's funny, I am from Brazil and since I was a baby, I took all the vaccines I can get and should get and I am completely fine. I have never heard of vaccines giving Autism until I came here to the U.S. and I am surprised at how U.S. citizens think that when Brazil citizens who don't think that, and on top of that, they live in a country with a lesser medical care.
1	It's gratifying to hear her call anti-vaxxers a cult. And it's scary to see how easily people became anti-vax.
0	It's poison
0	It's too bad YouTube did not allow people to criticize the SO-CALLED vaccine back when it actually could have saved some lives and misery.
1	It’s great to see people try to fix the anti vaccination problem, I feel like with videos like this, the problem will get better over time.
0	It’s just a rare side effect until it happens to you then it’s a reality and if you’ve been coerced then you realise you’ve been blackmailed into an experiment and lied to
0	It’s nothing about benefit it’s all about money
1	I’m guessing these anti-vaccers don’t wear seatbelts either? A seatbelt could kill a driver in a car accident but we still wear them for protection right?
1	I’m in so much amazement at how great humans are to be able to figure all this out!!
1	I’m so grateful to the smart people who developed them so quickly and saved millions of lives and brought us back some normal functioning.
1	I’ve gotten all the shots and boosters and have not yet gotten Covid.
0	I’ve heard from countless individuals that regret getting the covid jabs, who stopped getting more.
0	I’ve heard from countless individuals that regret getting the covid jabs, who stopped getting more. And I've talked to hundreds that have had zero, and not even one regrets their decision. In fact, the vast majority agree that not participating in this is one of the best decisions that we’ve ever made in our lives.
1	Just because you have one bad experience, doesn’t mean all vaccines are bad.
1	Just got my Pfizer Covid vaccine yesterday!!! 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭
1	Kid: when I grow up I-- Anti-Vax Mom: Imma stop you right there.
0	Last thing i want is that vaccine
0	Let's be honest; most doctors knew this vaccine was dangerous a couple of years ago. Doctors need to begin speaking out. Better late than never.
0	Lies
0	Lmao thank god I never got a booster.
0	Lol 90% effective until an hour passes and you need a new one
1	Long term effects of covid suck, please get the vaccine.
0	Look into Amish and Mennonite communities who do not vaccinate. They have almost zero autism rate. Maybe some brave doctor can study this population.
0	Lots of people regretting getting jabbed. None regretted not getting it. End of story. Good luck folks with the truth. It’s right there in front of you, like the pink elephant in the room.
0	MRNA translates RNA into amino acid pairs to create proteins. What happens when proteins are damaged? Problems with blood clotting, hormones, immune function, etc. All side effects we have seen so far are in fact from the problems with protein synthesis within the body.
1	Medical professional: here are the facts Professional googlers: no, no, no
1	Mine is 3 and vaxxed. No issues with any of her vaccines!
1	More power to every scientists who strive to create vaccines and to TedEd who keeps on informing us with the good and current news.
1	My Grandmother lost a 9 month old & 3 year old, on the same day, from Diptheria. My other Grandmother lost a 12 month old to Whooping Cough. My oldest brother almost died frrom Polio. I am so thankful that I was able to raise my boys, without having to worry about them dying from a preventable disease. A few generations ago parents did not have that luxury.
1	My Mom; a teacher is now vaccinated. She’s doing great!
1	My aunt already had her second shot an no real side effects. And i have been watching her close incase anything did.
1	My baby had zero side effects with Moderna. Got booster too when available. Months later household got COVID for the first time. He was asymptomatic! Huge peace of mind.
0	My body my choice, I have a perfectly healthy immune system thanks.
0	My brother just got the "pseudo tumor" in the arm than is now known as a somewhat common reaction to the jab (but not reported). They have removed this tumor and we wait for the biopsy reports. He doesn't look good...
0	My cousin started getting sick after she got vaccinated and now she has breast cancer!!
0	My dad almost died after getting his Covid shot. He was hospitalized then eventually moving to a retirement home. He lost the ability to walk after being bedridden for so many months.
0	My dad had blood clots cancer and a stroke after the shot. Now he's about to expire. A veteran of Vietnam and Korea,betrayed by our government.
1	My dad is high risk and got the first of two covid shots, he's getting his second one today and he has felt completely fine.
1	My daughter has a severe egg allergy and many vaccines are suspended in a type of egg protein. I strongly believe in vaccines because I have an autoimmune disease and heart condition. So I as a parent took my daughter to a specialist who did all her vaccines in divided dosages and we stayed in the office for 2 hours after each dosage. She is now a healthy 14 year old and has outgrown the egg allergy and has had ALL of her vaccines
0	My doctor said he would never take an experimental drug, end of story.
0	My family friends and I will not take the shots please don’t take the shots
1	My family got our 5th booster a month ago. YES PEOPLE ARE STILL GETTING COVID VACCINES!
1	My family still gets them. Why not get it, when Covid is still a thing? Getting mine with the flu shot.
0	My friend told me to quit being a baby and just get the vaccine. I didn't get the vaccine he did and now he's dead
0	My friend, who is 39, fit and healthy, was hospitalized with stroke-like symptoms yesterday. He received his second vaccine dose 3-4 weeks ago, his wife said he woke up in the morning and complained of his heart racing and difficulty breathing. While they were waiting for the ambulance she checked his heart rate with their blood oxygen finger monitor, his heart rate was at 155BPM. Can someone explain why a guy with no health issues had a reaction like this after getting the covid vaccination? I'm not anti-vax but this scares the hell out of me. I've heard reports of death and heart inflammation after getting the Covid vaccine, I feel like the vaccine will weaken the heart and cause health problems down the line for healthy adults 18-44.
0	My friends dad is physically fit doesn’t drink or smoke less than a week after having the jab he had a heart attack and same friends brother got a blood clot in his leg after the jab.
1	My grandparents are vaccinated now
1	My great auntie has just had her first dose of the vaccine! (she's 91)
0	My heart goes out to all that have been harmed by being a victim of mass criminal activity. I pray for justice
0	My in-laws take the shots because they’re normies and fall for everything the news tells them. Their cognitive abilities have degraded considerably. I feel sorry for them.
1	My kids are 1 and 4 and both vaccinated, at the recommendation of their pediatrician. I take the 4-year-old with me to the vaccine clinic in the fall and we get our Covid booster and our flu shot. He knows it's just part of staying healthy.
0	My mom got auto immune condition after vaccine of two doses. Our life has become hell.
0	My mom had to have the vaccine for her to be able to be considered a entry here in the US. Now she easily gets sick and fast…
0	My mother died 20 days after her vaccination - 24 hours after vax - she got thrombocytopenia and died a horrific death. Never will forgive for what happened.
0	My mother died of a stroke after her second vaccine. She’d never had a stroke before.
0	My mother has myocarditis as a side effect from the jab, and I don’t know anyone who died of covid.
0	My mother in law has deteriorated so bad constant headaches, rashes, and can’t remember Anything after her shots. Very active and mentally smart prior. Doctors deny it was jabs some nurses say opposite but afraid to say otherwise. I have zero trust in most doctors today.
0	My mother-in-law was a healthy woman until she got vaccinated and the boosters now she's completely lost her eyesight in one eye and has other health problems now.
1	My pregnant wife and I got ours a couple weeks ago, had a sore arm for a day or so, that’s about it. Herd immunity could completely eradicate this virus. Unfortunately looks like there are enough antivaxxer conspiracy theorists to ensure that the virus never goes away. Millions will die bc of some stupid facebook misinformation.
0	My question is what is going to be done about the blood banks The blood that is from vaccinated people Can we please have the blood banks collectioning non vaccinated blood
0	My sister in law had several strokes after her first booster. She was the healthier member of our family and in her early 50’s. She said she had felt different after the shots. I’m grateful I never got vaccinated. Bummed that two of my kids did get vaccinated
1	My son gave us all Covid and we didn’t even notice he was sick due to recently being vaccinated. Completely asymptomatic.
1	My son is almost two and has had all of his shots on schedule to date, including Covid and flu. There is nothing special about the Covid shot compared to other vaccines. The single worst part about every vaccine my kid has gotten has been taking the bandaids off lol. Take those bandaids off in the bath!
0	My whole body was sore where I could barely move for a few days after the first dose of the Moderna vaccine
1	My whole family and I had our vaccine. Slight headache and fatigue first dose of Pfizer but felt completely fine the 2nd dose. I recommend NOT to get the doses in the same arm! That will keep you from having the swelling or irritation. My peace of mind is something I haven't felt since this pandemic started...some actual hope and protection. Don't be afraid. You will be fine and you will feel so much better and the peace of mind alone is worth it.
1	My whole family got vaxed and avoided Covid. Last thing we want is Long Covid!
1	My whole family has taken the vaccine and we are all fine. It was worth it for us because we saw what happened to family and friend that got CV19.
0	My whole family said NO and we are all perfectly fine. It was horseshit from the start.
1	My work is giving it to everyone so I'm going to
0	NO! I will never put that in my body!!!
0	NOT a single unvaccinated person regrets standing their ground and refusing this shit. NOT ONE!
0	Nah imma wait until it is safer and proven to have no negative side effects
0	Natural immunity is better than any vaccine.
0	Natural immunity is better than artificial immunity.
0	Never get a "covid" jab, ever!!!
0	Never got the jab and have been fine so far, so I am not going to get one this late in the game.
0	Never in my life
0	Never seen a such marketing campaign for a vaccin. It's scary.
0	No no no no l l'm not doing it
0	No no no vaccines.
0	No to enforced medical 'treatments'.
0	No vaccine for me!
0	No way will I be having this untested jab
0	Nobody knows because it is not fully tested.
0	Nobody regrets not getting it, but plenty regret getting it.
1	Normal people: "The doctor surely knows what's up." Anti-vaxx: "I hAvE dOnE mY oWn ReSeArCh!!!"
0	Not a chance. Why don’t we focus on immune health and disease prevention instead of taking a vaccine for a disease that you’re Way more than likely to survive. Not worth the risk IMO.
0	Not so much forcing but blackmailing people. Saying we won't be able to go abroad unless we have the vaccine.
0	Not taking it. I'll remain pure human
0	Nothing says "trust the science" quite like "you can't sue us if something goes wrong" and "we need 75 years to release the data to the public".
0	Nothing wrong with being an "antivaxer", why would you put untested products free from liability in your body?
1	Of course! Got both my annual flu and Covid vaccines 2 weeks ago. My kids too!
0	Only problem is they don't work.
0	People lost jobs, homes, close family and friends in the beginning because they said no to getting it. They were right all along..
0	People should have had the choice and discussion rather than censorship and gas lighting.
0	People who got it are changing and they are getting cruel Has anyone else noticed this
1	Picture this: You’re on the Titanic. The ship is sinking. All the lifeboats are taken. Leonardo Decaprio found a piece of floating plank and made a makeshift floatation device. You refuse to get on because it was “rushed”. You drown.
1	Please bring those vaccines to Africa, specifically Kenya. I know so many children who would really appreciate them.
1	Please go out and spread the word... Of getting Vaccinated. Such exciting tech.
0	Please take a look at two documentaries: "Vaxed " and "Vaxed 2". Real people's experiences with childhood vaccine injuries.
1	Pray to God to make the COVID-19 Vaccine ready by the end of the year 2020 going into the new year 2021
0	REPOST if you want to see Covid vaccine manufacturers be held liable for injuries!
0	Reading al these comments made me happy, there is still common sense in the world. Restist this covid brainwashing and never let them vaccinate/infect you.
0	Remember when all of you were trying to get the Non Vaxxed arrested and put into jail times ticking
0	Risks you say? Well when businesses were mandating it for people to work without them knowing the risks. I'm just so grateful that I never took the vaccine even though I lost my 20 year career at a hospital. I'm still alive. Had covid 14 months ago . No problem. My symptoms were less than my friends that are vaccinated.
0	Safe and effective products don’t require threats, coercion and intimidation.
0	Safe and effective, tell that to the people who died or are disabled.
0	Same thing happened to my wife Aunt. Took it and didn’t make it 48hrs
1	Seeing that it only took less than 1 year to make the current mRNA vaccine, it made me realised that the medical field had really came a long way
0	Several older acquaintances have reported experiencing cardiac complications following vaccination, necessitating ongoing medication and expressing regret about their decision.
1	Shoutout to all the hard work of scientists over this last year. We really take their work for granted.
0	Since this is relatively new how do they know that they’re won’t be some unwelcome side effects?
1	Smart people do! Stay safe.
1	So Christopher's parents in their 70s who were vaccinated and got covid are still alive but Christopher who wasnt vaccinated and got covid died.
0	So glad I never got any of the covid vaccines.
0	So glad I was able to resist the pressure to get injected with that garbage.
0	So glad my and my wife never got This poison injected in us.
0	So relieved that I didn’t crumble, I remained strong and do not have that poison in my body !!
0	So you guys believe it is safe,because you listened to what the media(government) told you.How do you know what's in the vaccine will be fatal in couple of months or years
1	Someone without a vaccine: Germs: It’s free real estate
0	Something that is safe shouldn’t be mandatory. Wakeup people
0	Still unvaxed! I bet it shaves like 30 years off your life.
0	Still waiting on part 2 How the Vaccine Side Effects Work
1	Sure do. Dragged my husband to the CVS on the corner the day the new vaccine was available and went ahead and did the flu shot. Also making me anxious I can’t get it for my 8 year old yet.
0	Thank God I never had the vaccines
1	Thank God for this vaccine I just contracted COVID-19 but the length of being sick seemed short compared to those who are not vaccinated and I am also immune compromised. I’d say I had mild to moderate symptoms. The moderate symptoms occurred only bc my body was reacting to the initial infection so I did have fever and pounding headache for only 1 day now I having mild symptoms such light headache, reduced fever, more alert as if I am already getting better. I truly feel if I was not vaccinated my recovery would longer and my sickness would be severe.
1	Thank god they came out when they did. My dumbass family didn't take covid seriously until my aunt died (from contracting 'rona at a family gathering I specifically told everyone not to go to). Whoever was peddling those bullshit conspiracies about bill gates, 5g, microchips and sterilisation will deservedly burn in hell
1	Thank you for clarifying that we didn't have NO experience with mRNA. We had not had a vaccine based on it at that point. But the research into mRNA vaccines goes back decades before the COVID vaccine.
1	Thank you. Explaining this to patients is often a hassle but important!
1	Thanks for encouraging people to get vaccinated.
1	Thanks to everyone doing their civic duty and getting vaccinated. Things have been opening up for everyone to enjoy mostly thanks to you who are willing to make some personal sacrifices.
1	That man questioning whether vaccine is safe while his mom is in icu for Covid is really tragic... It's like someone being hesitant on seat belts while their child is in icu from being ejected from their car 30 feet...
1	Thats something very good
1	The Covid 19 vaccines are nothing short of a medical miracle. They indicate that we're on the verge of a new era in medicine.
0	The Covid vaccine caused more harm than good and killed & maimed many people. Period!!
1	The Covid-19 Vaccine safe life thanks god it came out
0	The best bit about being anti vaxx is not having myocarditis. The doctors who tried to force this jab need struck off.
0	The best thing to do is have a strong immune system and avoid vaccines as much as possible.There will always be an improvement in vaccine..we dont know what kind of anti bodies it would create.
0	The biggest question is, why are you trying to force something on me I don't want?
0	The government doesn't get to say what goes into your veins.
1	The government should make it a requirement for children to be vaccinated before they can attend school!!
1	The hospitalized guy: "I'd rather be here, with a massive medical bill, than take a completely free and relatively safe vaccine"
1	The idea that the Covid vaccines "didn't work" is a myth that has taken hold. The vaccines played a key role in ending the pandemic.
1	The irony of people smoking while acting like they care about what goes in their bodies
1	The lady who said she’s anti-vaxx because of a bad reaction…. If you were allergic to peanut butter, would you be anti-peanut butter? Same with bees, grass, etc.
1	The older you get, the longer and harder it is to recover from illnesses. It’s best to be safe than sorry.
0	The only question I'd ask the reporter and anyone else: "How can you be suuuure, the vaccine is safe?"
1	The people who think that going All natural is a good thing forget about the most important natural thing. Natural selection.
1	The people who think that these vaccines contain microchips are the same people who forget their phone passcode and blame the government for changing it.
0	The rest in peace vaccine!
0	The same people bashing on “anti-vaxxers” are the same people saying “my body my choice.” Pathetic.
0	The second vaccine affected me neurologically so badly I was unable to work in my field any longer.
1	The sheer audacity they have to compare their inconveniences with the suffering that the victims of the holocaust experienced is enough to drive any sensible person to rage.
1	The situation is entirely different in the Philippines... People are lining up to get a shot but there isn't enough of it.
1	The thing that anti vaxxers don’t get is that if a person is allergic to vaccines and can’t be vaccinated, that person is actually being protected from diseases by herd immunity, by people who are vaccinated. This is why vaccines are important.
1	The vaccine cured
0	The vaccine doesn't stop transmission
1	The vaccine is safe. Danielle Nicole Jones (also known as Mama Doctor Jones) has done a lot of research on the vaccine, and she has said it is safe.
0	The vaccine is so safe that the CEO hasn't taken the vaccine until only a few months ago which I still don't think he got the vaccine he just says he did. If they knew it worked right away why would he wait a year to take it?
1	The vaccine saved my life.
1	The vaccine should be mandatory. Actually all standard vaccines should be mandatory
1	The vaccine won’t be available for me until mid 2021 because of where I live and I’m not high risk whatsoever but I’m 100% planning on getting it when available (even tho I get panic attacks when I get shots)
1	The way that these mRNA vaccines work is so freakin cool. The scientists developing this vaccination tech did some seriously groundbreaking work. We’re living in the future.
0	There are no benefits from the vaccine!
0	There are too many unknowns about the long-term effects of these vaccines.
0	There is no debate over safety if long term studies have not been done. You can't call it safe, in fact its hugely irresponsible and liable claims should be filed against those who say its safe without any long term effects data available. If its safe then allow Phizer etc to be sued over any future adverse effects.
0	There was a significant benefit to vaccinating young adults and children. It was to increase the flow of money to the drug companies and also from the drug companies to CDC and NIH employees. They knew it caused adverse reactions to young people but they pushed it anyway.
0	These are people! Mothers, Father's, Sister's, Brother's, Grandparents.... and the list goes on and on. WE ARE NOT LAB RATS. WE ARE NOT STATISTICS. WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS!
1	They are fine.
1	They are fine. My partner and family members are at-risk health wish and to me it’s just another poke along with my flu vaccine appointment.
0	They forced you to choose between heart failure or Lose your job.
0	They were so right..:: the rest of us were led like sheep. I regret ever having put that crap in my body.
0	They work poorly and no amount of cool animation can change that.
0	This documentary sickened me to my core. And further convinced me that I would never take it. Well done to Nazarin for standing up for herself.
0	This is a huge crime against humanity. SHAME ON THESE PEOPLE.
1	This is fantastic engineering work. Way to go, biotechnology.
0	This is gaslighting. Trying to tell her that her friend’s injury was random and there was no causal relationship to the kool-aide, gaslighting.
0	This is only the three year study !!! Wait until we hear the damage of the five and ten year studies !!! I'm sure it will get worse over time !!! I wasn't vaccinated for covid and I'm so happy, neither were any of my immediate family members !!! THANKFUL !!!
1	This is so hard to watch. My mother died back in December and she didn’t have the option of getting the vaccine, but she would have taken it if it was available. It’s heartbreaking to see these people because they could have prevented if. Yes people are getting sick, but the odds of dying are highly reduced when vaccinated.
0	This is so sad. I wouldn’t get the shot. I’m sorry for those who were forced to or forced out of a job or the military
0	This is still very much a pro vaccine discussion. Labeling parents who choose not to vaccinate as child abuse... ridiculous!!
0	This is the greatest crime against humanity in history
0	This madness will stop if we all collectively say "No!"
1	Those antivaxxers really seem to want their kids to win the life speedrun competition.
0	Those that created, those that persuading and mandating the jab are CRIMINALLY INSANE.
1	To the people scared of needles, I got my last vaccination a while ago! Neither of them hurt, you can feel a pinch and after that you can’t even notice the needle is in your arm! My arm hurt and I had a slight headache about a day or two after, but it’s definitely not nearly as bad as Covid!
1	Trust science!
1	Trust the doctors and the scientists.
0	Unvaccinated are the ones which will come out of this
1	Vaccinated
1	Vaccinations and the science behind them have saved us from some pretty serious illness and improved millions of lives. If you don’t want it don’t get it. I trust the science and I think being vaccinated is sensible and altruistic.
1	Vaccine works people! :)
1	Vaccines are safe
1	Vaccines are the best invention.
0	Wasnt some kind of study supposed to be done before they let it out to the public? This is scary as h*ll that they didnt know this beforehand.
0	We already have our own immune response and don’t need a jab.
1	We have got them in the UK and its being rolling out cant wait to get the vaccine.
0	We have no idea what all is in it. Can't trust them for the truth.
1	We have to remember that no medicine is without side effects. If it doesn't have any side effects then chances are it doesn't do anything.
1	We need this video translated to other languages. There are people who fear the vaccine because they don't know what it is and how it works.
0	Well I've seen my friends still gets covid by the fact that they are fully vaccinated for months now.
1	Well obviously, but I wanna make sure my parents get it first
1	Well, after receiving the 2nd shot I had a sort of mild fever and headache. The experience was worse than that of the 1st shot. I couldn't sleep. Also had injection site pain which isn't a big deal cuz it's a very common and natural side effect. However, I am doing well now and I am fine.
0	What I don't understand is how all the country's that were producing their emergency Covid-19 vaccines, managed to design, test & manufacture them all within a very similar time period as everyone else, And coincidently they all require multiple booster shots after a similar number of months as everyone else's designs, and of course, these booster shots have all past their testing (without side effects, too.) Amazing coincidences, Mind-blowing!
0	What’s wrong with a natural immune system?
1	When I was 13, I choked on food. I stopped eating as I didn’t want to increase my risk of choking again. Join me and stop eating, don’t feed your children either, as they might choke aswell.
0	When a politician is threatening you with losing your job if you don't get an injection you should probably avoid it at all costs
0	When asked if the Monkeys would be taking the experimental concoction, the President of the Council of Monkeys said "We will wait until the human trials have ended before making our decision".
0	When you start adding the deadly blood clots, the strokes, heart attacks, pericarditis & myocarditis, embolysms, paralysis, then, clearly, the severe adverse raction aren't that "rare" at all.
1	Where I come from it's considered child abuse not to vaccinate your kids. You could actually face some jail time for disregarding basic human rights. (Well it's basic in my mind anyway)
0	Who is going to get a vaccine rushed through development in months? Up to you.
1	Why I don't vaccinate my- Never mind. He dead.
0	Why do the protected need to be protected from the unprotected by forcing the unprotected to use the protection that didnt protect the protected in the first place? I will not be taking it.
0	Why do they call for extreme lockdowns over a few covid cases, but the neurological side effects which is affecting thousands upon thousands of people are called "rare" side effects?
0	Why isn't the news media covering the 70 year old New Yorker who died 25 minutes after getting the vaccine Sunday?
0	Why poison your kids with that junk? It will make them sicker than COVID
0	Yeah I cancelled my Air Force contract because they were gonna force me to get vaccine.
1	Yeah, I'll probably get it. I've had COVID this year already and was not a fan (my immune system sucks too). Had to stay inside for an ENTIRE MONTH! Couldn't even go out to get the mail! Not a good time for anyone right now. My parents will probably get that too since they're in the age range of most in danger & have immune problems of their own.
1	Yeah, I’m immune compromised so I get a Covid vaccine when I get my flu shot and anywhere it’s reported to be active, I wear a mask. Safety matters.
0	Years ago people trusted the government more. Who really trusts their government now?
1	Yep we got our son vaccinated for everything as soon as he was old enough, including Covid and the flu. Better safe than sorry.
1	Yes absolutely. It’s still out there with serious long term consequences so why wouldn’t you do what you can to minimise it’s hold on you should you get it.
1	Yes of course. Got Novavax a few weeks ago.
1	Yes, I still get mine every year. Some random boomer I don’t know certainly does not speak for me.
1	Yes, and flu shot too. And whatever else my medical provider recommends.
1	Yes, currently kicking myself for not keeping up with the boosters. Raging case of Covid the last three days. :/
1	Yes, family of four. All got flu and Covid vaccines last week. Pediatrician recommended as well. Side effects were not too bad.
1	Yes, i get mine with my flu shot every year now. My office had a bad outbreak this summer. We were all wearing masks for almost 3 months. Also i was diagnosed with Addison’s disease last year and a bout of Covid could potentially kill me.
1	Yes, the vaccines now are much better and protect against newer variants
1	Yes. I'll take whatever protection I can get. I don't enjoy being sick or making others sick.
1	Yes. My father died from it so, yes, I’ll keep getting boosted.
1	Yes. We need it just like the flu shot. The varient changes yearly.
1	You can compare this with seatbelts. Yes,some died because they couldn't get out of the car fast enough but it still prevented a lot of deaths and harm.
1	You can get sick if you want. I got the booster with no issues or concerns.
1	You can get vaccinated at your nearest pharmacy. I took my grandchildren and my parents . We were all vaccinated at the same time and not one of us got sick after .
0	You didn't explain how the mRNA escapes the protective lipid once in the body, for the mRNA to attach itself to the ribosomes. That's a rather important part. If mRNA gets chemically damaged in any way, it can possibly tell your body to make the wrong protein.
0	You forgot the con being it kills you, or makes you wish you were dead.
1	You just convinced me to not be picky about vaccines. Thank You!
0	You know what I find amazing, is that people will go out of their way to not accuse the covid vaccine of any harm, And yet so quick to blame the covid infection for every death and hospitalization , even though people had many comorbidities, obesity, things that cause death all by themselves.
0	You left out the part where the VAXXINE gives you blood clots and injures your heart
0	You should be afraid of this vaccine. People blindly follow an experimental drug and just because the people at the top say it’s safe and effective.
1	Yup of course. Same people saying they wont, will be the same fools first in line when their jobs make it mandatory
1	Yup. Finally got covid for the first time this week, and I'm grateful that I got the new booster just last month, because this sucks enough as it.
1	Yup. Just got flu plus COVID shot yesterday. My incentive: every time you get covid reduces your cognitive abilities.
0	a lot of people in our area died after vaccination against covid, including those relatively young under 50 years old.
1	all these anti-vax memes will never die, which is actually pretty ironic.
1	even if it did cause autism, id much rather have a few more people get autism then them starting a disease outbreak
1	everyone should take two vaccinations. No need to argue
0	glad i dont have to worry about long term side effects. i just didnt take it
1	got fully vaccinated. Then after a month i got covid hehe... Still thankful for being vaccinated. I have a lot of medical problems that is respiratory related in my previous years such an bronchitis and pneumonia. If i haven't gotten any vaccine. I may have severe symptoms. Luckily i was just classified as asymptomatic when i got covid.
1	got my 3rd shot today ... <3
1	how are the anti-vaxxers talking about the pros downplaying something while completely downplaying all the risks of not vaxxing themselves?
1	how long after the vaccine? Also even if you got ill from the vaccine, you should still take it because it’s extremely rare to get side effects from vaccines and normally the side effects aren’t severe
1	i got both of my covid-19 vaccines already
1	i had my jab today and it is astrazeneca no side effects so far. in Australia.
1	i was down for 2 whole days after second vaccine. at that time i was in bad shape, and i was happy i got it. if i got the real infection , it would have been much much worse. so better to suffer for 2 days than in breathing help machine for months.
1	if you believe the vaccine is dangerous you have fallen for fear mongering propaganda, im so sorry
1	im living in a country where we have shortage of vaccines coz everyone wants to have it if you don't want it just give it to us.
0	im unvaxed and perfectly fine ! its ppl that got the shots are dying slowly careful about hospitals now days alot of them are under trained in logic !
1	just got my second dose one week ago! I really do hope that everyone will get vaccinated soon!! i want to go out without the fear of getting sick.
0	many Doctors are horrified by the unknown factors of this experimental vaccine. This potentially could be the Frankenstein vaccine! No one should risk it. Its crazy. Its like a group of mad scientists have taken over.
0	never buy the vehicle with the all-new designed engine and new technology because there will be issues, wait until they work all the flaws out because there will be flaws
0	not getting jabbed is dangerous for big pharma's shareholders
0	pure blooded here babyyy 😎🔥💯
1	science <3
1	so basically, if a bridge was 96.80%, you would prefer to swim with the 3.20%
1	some people ignore the benefits of vaccine and just complain about the complication
1	the human body is amazing the way it fights for your health
1	the ppl I know who got fully vaccinated and got COVID had slight cold like symptoms and got over it in a couple of days without having to go to the hospital.... the ppl I know who did not get vaccinated died... know the difference and educate your self without being influenced by stupid ppl
1	the vaccine should be mandatory
1	these people really think they’re smarter in the medicinal field than actual doctors. wow
1	vaccines have been proved to be safe & effective but some of us like to ignore facts
1	vaccines should be mandatory if for a disease as serious as this, unless you're allergic to them
1	we lost our uncle to covid. he was such a loving man but he was afraid of getting vaccinated, like most of our family. After his death, my parents started to take it seriously enough to consider getting the vaccine. Unfortunately, that clarity of mind didn't last too long and a while after they changed their minds again. I couldn't get vaccinated as I was under 18 and they wouldn't allow it and soon after we all ended up getting the virus. My father and mother have both been left with permanent health consequences. It is wild what misinformation can do to our world.
1	what anti-vaxxers really, REALLY need to know is, correlation doesn’t cause causation.
0	when has the government ever been transparent!!!!!!!
0	yea no thx ima watch yall get super sick or turn into monsters in 4 years since there's no research done on it
1	yes. absolutely. i have a friend that stidies with the ways COVID works. he's highly suggesting every booster possible. be safe
0	“Experts pointed out that NOT getting vaccinated is still more dangerous.” Okay, Experts.
0	“The vaccine should be tested on politicians first. If they survive, the vaccine is safe. If they don’t, then the country is safe.”
0	“The vaccine was not brought in for COVID. COVID was brought in for the vaccine. Once you realize that, everything else makes sense.” ~ Dr. Reiner Fuellmich
1	“This bridge is only 99% safe so we should just swim in the shark infested water”
